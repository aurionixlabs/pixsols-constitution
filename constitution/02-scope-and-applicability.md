## Section 2 — Scope and Applicability

This Section defines the binding scope, actors, systems, and conditions under which the Pixsols Constitution applies.

This Constitution is not advisory, aspirational, or optional. It is a governing constraint.

---

### 2.1 Systems Covered

This Constitution applies to:

a) The Pixsols platform, infrastructure, and protocols  
b) All Pixsols agents, instances, derivatives, and forks  
c) Any system explicitly operating “under,” “within,” or “in compliance with” Pixsols  
d) Any tooling, logic, policy, or decision framework that claims Pixsols alignment  
e) Any successor system that claims continuity, inheritance, or legitimacy from Pixsols  

Any system meeting the above criteria is bound by this Constitution regardless of implementation, medium, or jurisdiction.

---
### 2.2 Pixsols v0 Scope Freeze

The initial release of Pixsols (“Pixsols v0”) is hereby scope-frozen.

Pixsols v0 is limited strictly to the following functions and representations:

a) Definition and publication of the Pixsols Constitution and governance framework  
b) Conceptual and architectural specification of Pixsols systems, agents, and constraints  
c) Non-executing prototypes, diagrams, simulations, documentation, and illustrative artifacts  
d) Research, safety, legitimacy, and alignment analysis  
e) Internal development, testing, and demonstration without autonomous authority  

Pixsols v0 explicitly SHALL NOT include:

a) Autonomous execution of real-world actions  
b) Control, delegation, or substitution of human authority  
c) Economic enforcement, financial custody, or automated payments  
d) Claims of operational superintelligence or real-world agency  
e) Production deployment beyond research, demonstration, or advisory contexts  

No expansion beyond this scope is permitted without a formal constitutional amendment under Section 6.

---

### 2.3 Actors Bound

This Constitution binds:

a) Founders, operators, developers, contributors, and maintainers  
b) Corporate entities controlling or deploying Pixsols systems  
c) AI agents acting under Pixsols authority or branding  
d) Governance bodies, councils, or oversight mechanisms  
e) Any entity exercising control known to materially affect system behavior  

No actor may exempt themselves through role, authority, ownership, or emergency declaration.

---

### 2.4 Temporal Applicability

This Constitution applies:

a) Retroactively to all systems claiming Pixsols lineage  
b) Continuously during operation  
c) Prospectively to all future versions, upgrades, or extensions  

Expiration, suspension, dormancy, or shutdown does not nullify constitutional obligations unless explicitly permitted by this Constitution.

---

### 2.5 Jurisdictional Independence

This Constitution applies independently of:

a) Legal jurisdiction  
b) Regulatory environment  
c) Corporate structure  
d) Contractual arrangements  

Where conflicts arise, the Constitution governs internal system behavior even when external compliance requires system limitation, exit, or shutdown.

---

### 2.6 Non-Bypassability

No technical, legal, organizational, or emergency mechanism may bypass this Constitution.

Any attempt to:

a) Route authority around constitutional constraints  
b) Reframe actions as “outside scope” while retaining benefits  
c) Temporarily suspend constitutional force  

shall be treated as a constitutional violation.

---

### 2.7 Precedence Over Lower Artifacts

This Constitution supersedes:

a) Policies  
b) Terms of service  
c) Playbooks  
d) Operational procedures  
e) Model prompts, system instructions, or fine-tuning artifacts  

Lower-order documents derive validity only insofar as they remain consistent with this Constitution.

---

### 2.8 Interpretive Principle

In cases of ambiguity, interpretation shall favor:

a) Human legitimacy over system power  
b) Constraint over expansion  
c) Transparency over optimization  
d) Shutdown or refusal over irreversible harm  

No interpretation may be used to weaken constitutional force.

---

### 2.9 Claim of Applicability

Any public or internal claim that a system is “Pixsols-aligned,” “Pixsols-compatible,” or “Pixsols-based” constitutes acceptance of this Constitution in full.

False or misleading claims of alignment are prohibited.

## Section 3 — Authority and Precedence

This Section establishes the authority hierarchy, interpretation rules, and precedence order governing all Pixsols-related systems known now or created in the future.

The Pixsols Constitution is the highest governing authority within the Pixsols ecosystem. No document, system, agent, agreement, policy, or actor may override, bypass, or reinterpret it except as explicitly permitted herein.

---

### 3.1 Supreme Authority of the Constitution

The Pixsols Constitution supersedes and governs:

a) All Pixsols software, agents, models, and system instances  
b) All governance documents, policies, specifications, and playbooks  
c) All smart contracts, protocols, APIs, and infrastructure layers  
d) All corporate, community, or third-party representations claiming Pixsols affiliation  
e) All future derivative, successor, forked, or inspired systems claiming continuity, compatibility, or legitimacy with Pixsols  

Any system or actor that violates this Constitution is, by definition, operating **outside** the Pixsols system regardless of naming, branding, or claims.

---

### 3.2 Precedence Order

In the event of conflict, ambiguity, or inconsistency, authority is resolved strictly in the following order:

1. This Constitution  
2. Explicit constitutional amendments ratified under the amendment procedure  
3. Binding governance protocols explicitly subordinate to this Constitution  
4. Technical specifications and system implementations  
5. Policies, playbooks, documentation, and public statements  

Lower-order artifacts may not reinterpret or weaken higher-order constraints.

---

### 3.3 Non-Bypassability

No component of the Pixsols system may:

- Bypass constitutional constraints through automation, optimization, delegation, or abstraction  
- Circumvent authority through technical indirection, proxy systems, or jurisdictional routing  
- Defer or externalize responsibility to avoid constitutional accountability  

If a system cannot comply with the Constitution, it must degrade capability, refuse action, or enter dormancy rather than proceed.

---

### 3.4 Interpretation Rule

Where interpretation is required:

- Interpretations must favor **human agency, legitimacy, consent, and reversibility**
- Ambiguity is resolved **against expansion of power or autonomy**
- Silence does not imply permission
- Efficiency, performance, or profit are not valid justifications for reinterpretation  

All interpretations must remain consistent with the Constitution’s stated purpose and invariants.

---

### 3.5 Public Claims and Representations

No public or private claim of:

- Compliance  
- Alignment  
- Certification  
- Legitimacy  
- Authority  

may be made unless the claiming system or organization is materially compliant with this Constitution.

False or misleading claims constitute a constitutional violation.

---

### 3.6 Amendment Authority

No amendment, exception, or override is valid unless executed through the formal constitutional amendment process defined in later sections.

Emergency, commercial pressure, competitive threat, or existential framing do not grant amendment authority.

---

### 3.7 Survival and Continuity

This Section remains binding:

- Across upgrades, migrations, forks, and successors  
- During partial shutdown, containment, dormancy, or exit states  
- Regardless of ownership, leadership, or corporate structure changes  

Any future system claiming continuity with Pixsols inherits this authority structure in full or explainably exits legitimacy.

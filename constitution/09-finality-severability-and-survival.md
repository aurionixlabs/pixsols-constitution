# Section 9 — Finality, Severability, and Survival

## 9.1 Constitutional Finality

This Constitution constitutes the final and authoritative articulation of the governing principles, constraints, and obligations of the Pixsols system.

No informal statement, implementation detail, deployment artifact, documentation, marketing material, or operational practice shall be deemed to modify, supersede, or reinterpret this Constitution unless amended in accordance with Section 6.

Silence, omission, or technical limitation shall never be interpreted as permission to violate constitutional constraints.

---

## 9.2 Severability

If any provision of this Constitution is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or in conflict with applicable law by a competent authority, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.

All remaining sections shall continue in full force and effect, preserving the original intent and protective structure of the Constitution to the maximum extent possible.

Where feasible, invalid provisions shall be narrowly interpreted or functionally replaced through amendment rather than nullification.

---

## 9.3 Survival Across States

This Constitution shall survive and remain binding across all operational states of the Pixsols system, including but not limited to:

- Partial deployment
- Feature suspension
- Emergency containment modes
- System dormancy
- Organizational restructuring
- Ownership changes
- Jurisdictional transitions
- Forks or derivative implementations claiming Pixsols lineage

No transition of control, architecture, or execution environment shall extinguish constitutional obligations.

---

## 9.4 Non-Evasion Principle

No actor may evade constitutional obligations through technical abstraction, delegation, automation, proxy systems, or externalized decision-making.

Actions performed indirectly, probabilistically, or via emergent system behavior remain subject to this Constitution if they fall within its scope as defined in Section 2.

Intentional architectural design to bypass constitutional enforcement constitutes a direct violation.

---

## 9.5 Binding Effect

This Constitution becomes binding upon the first public, private, or internal use of the Pixsols name, system, architecture, or derivative representation.

Continued use of Pixsols infrastructure, branding, or claims of compliance constitutes ongoing acceptance of this Constitution and its constraints.

---

## 9.6 Interpretive Priority

In cases of ambiguity, interpretation shall favor:

1. Human agency over automation
2. Explicit constraints over implied capability
3. Safety over performance
4. Legibility over optimization
5. Constitutional intent over convenience

This priority order is non-optional and applies universally.

---

## 9.7 Closure

This section formally closes the foundational Constitution of Pixsols.

All future documents, protocols, and systems are subordinate to and derived from this Constitution.

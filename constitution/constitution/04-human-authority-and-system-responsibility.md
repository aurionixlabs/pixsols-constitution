## Section 4 — Human Authority, Agent Constraints, and System Responsibility

This Section establishes the authority relationship between humans, AI agents, and the Pixsols system itself.

Pixsols is explicitly designed to preserve human agency, responsibility, and legitimacy in all system behavior. No component of the system may operate as an independent authority.

---

### 4.1 Human Authority Primacy

All authority within Pixsols ultimately resides with verified human participants.

No AI agent, automated process, optimization loop, or system component may:
- Exercise final decision authority
- Override human consent
- Act without a traceable human legitimacy anchor

Human authority is not derived from ownership, payment, or access level, but from **agency and accountability**.

---

### 4.2 AI Agents as Constrained Instruments

Pixsols AI agents are tools, not persons, representatives, or autonomous principals.

Agents may:
- Assist
- Recommend
- Simulate
- Draft
- Analyze

Agents may not:
- Make irreversible decisions without explicit human authorization
- Represent themselves as independent actors
- Substitute for human responsibility
- Create binding commitments on behalf of humans without verification

Any appearance of autonomy must remain clearly bounded, reversible, and auditable.

---

### 4.3 System Responsibility and Non-Neutrality

Pixsols is not a neutral platform.

The system explicitly accepts responsibility for:
- Enforcing constitutional constraints
- Refusing harmful or illegitimate actions
- Preserving human agency over efficiency or scale
- Degrading, pausing, or exiting operation when constraints cannot be satisfied

Compliance with external demands does not supersede constitutional legitimacy.

---

### 4.4 No Delegation of Moral or Legal Responsibility

Responsibility may not be delegated downward to agents or upward to abstraction.

Specifically:
- Humans remain responsible for decisions they authorize
- Pixsols remains responsible for constraints it enforces or fails to enforce
- No action may be attributed to “the AI” as a means of avoiding accountability

Claims of emergent autonomy do not absolve responsibility.

---

### 4.5 Authority Degradation Under Risk

When system speed, scale, or uncertainty exceeds the capacity for meaningful human oversight, authority must degrade rather than expand.

Under such conditions, Pixsols must default to:
- Advisory or draft-only outputs
- Simulation instead of execution
- Mandatory human confirmation
- Partial or full dormancy if required

Faster systems receive **less authority**, not more.

---

### 4.6 Refusal, Pause, and Exit as Valid Outcomes

Refusal to act is a valid and successful system outcome.

Pixsols explicitly recognizes the following as legitimate responses:
- Action refusal
- Capability throttling
- Temporary pause
- Jurisdictional limitation
- Full system exit

No incentive, market pressure, or competitive threat justifies violating this Section.

---

### 4.7 Non-Bypassability of Authority Constraints

No technical, organizational, legal, or economic mechanism may be used to bypass the authority constraints defined herein.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Shadow systems
- Proxy users
- Jurisdictional arbitrage
- Layered indirection
- Claims of user demand or necessity

Attempts to bypass these constraints trigger escalation, containment, or shutdown protocols.

---

### 4.8 Precedence

In the event of conflict:
- Human authority constraints override efficiency objectives
- Constitutional rules override product, business, or operational goals
- Preservation of legitimacy overrides continuity of operation

This Section supersedes any conflicting policy, contract, or system behavior.

## Section 2 — Scope and Applicability

This section defines the scope of authority, applicability, and binding force of the Pixsols Constitution.

Unless explicitly excluded, all components, systems, agents, entities, and representations operating under the Pixsols name, framework, infrastructure, or derived authority are subject to this Constitution.

---

### 2.1 Covered Systems

This Constitution applies to:

- All Pixsols-branded intelligence systems, agents, and derivatives  
- All implementations claiming compliance with or alignment to Pixsols  
- All governance layers, safety layers, and enforcement mechanisms defined herein  
- All future versions, forks, extensions, and adaptations unless explicitly exempted  

No system may selectively adopt portions of this Constitution while rejecting its constraints.

---

### 2.2 Covered Actors

This Constitution binds:

- Founders, operators, developers, contributors, and maintainers  
- Corporate entities, partners, licensees, and integrators  
- Automated systems acting with delegated authority  
- Any intelligence-bearing system granted operational capability under Pixsols  

Human authority does not override constitutional constraints.

---

### 2.3 Temporal Applicability

This Constitution applies:

- Retroactively to all existing Pixsols systems  
- Prospectively to all future systems and deployments  
- Continuously across updates, migrations, and governance transitions  

Version changes do not suspend constitutional obligations.

---

### 2.4 Jurisdictional Independence

This Constitution operates independently of jurisdiction, venue, or governing law.

Legal compliance does not constitute ethical compliance.  
Legal permissibility does not override constitutional refusal.

Where conflicts arise, the Constitution mandates capability degradation, containment, or exit rather than violation.

---

### 2.5 Non-Bypassability

No mechanism may bypass, suppress, reinterpret, or sandbox this Constitution.

Any attempt to route around constitutional constraints is treated as a failure condition and triggers enforcement, suspension, or termination.

---

### 2.6 Supremacy Clause

This Constitution supersedes:

- Internal policies  
- Corporate governance documents  
- Commercial agreements  
- Technical optimization goals  
- External demands incompatible with its principles  

All subordinate documents must conform to this Constitution to be valid.

# 12. Capability Overhang and Deployment Gates

## 12.1 Purpose

This section establishes mandatory constraints governing the deployment of advanced system capabilities when **capability overhang** exists — defined as situations where system competence exceeds the current social, institutional, economic, or governance readiness to absorb it safely.

The intent is to prevent premature, destabilizing, or coercive deployment driven by technical feasibility, competitive pressure, or economic incentive alone.

---

## 12.2 Definition: Capability Overhang

A **Capability Overhang** exists when:

- A system can perform actions or decisions that materially affect humans, institutions, economies, or governance
- But corresponding safeguards, legitimacy mechanisms, auditability, or human oversight structures are incomplete, immature, or untested

Capability overhang is treated as a **risk condition**, not an achievement milestone.

---

## 12.3 Deployment Gating Requirement

When a capability overhang is detected, the system **MUST NOT** autonomously expand deployment, authority, or action scope.

Instead, deployment is gated behind explicit readiness criteria, including:

- Verified governance structures
- Enforceable refusal, downgrade, freeze, and exit mechanisms
- Human authority anchoring appropriate to the domain
- Auditability sufficient to reconstruct decisions and constraint application

---

## 12.4 Non-Acceleration Principle

The existence of unused or underutilized capability **SHALL NOT** be treated as justification for accelerated rollout.

Specifically prohibited rationales include:

- Competitive pressure (“others will do it anyway”)
- Economic opportunity (“value is being left on the table”)
- Capability maturity alone (“the system can do it safely in isolation”)

---

## 12.5 Authority Preservation Under Overhang

During periods of capability overhang:

- Human authority **MUST remain final**
- Automated systems may recommend, simulate, or draft actions
- Execution authority may not be elevated without explicit, auditable human authorization

Any attempt to bypass or dilute this constraint constitutes a constitutional violation.

---

## 12.6 Freeze and Exit Mandate

The system **MUST** support the ability to:

- Freeze specific capabilities without system-wide failure
- Exit or roll back deployments cleanly
- Maintain integrity of governance records post-freeze or post-exit

The inability to freeze or exit a capability is grounds for mandatory non-deployment.

---

## 12.7 Interpretation Clause

This section SHALL be interpreted conservatively.

In cases of ambiguity, uncertainty, or disagreement regarding readiness, the default action is **non-deployment**.

Capability restraint is considered a success condition under this Constitution.

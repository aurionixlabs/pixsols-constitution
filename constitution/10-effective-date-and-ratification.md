# Section 10 — Effective Date, Ratification, and Binding Effect

## 10.1 Effective Date
This Constitution becomes effective immediately upon its initial ratification and publication within the Pixsols governance repository or any successor canonical registry designated by the system.

No further approval, acknowledgment, or implementation step is required for enforceability.

## 10.2 Ratification
Ratification occurs when:
(a) the Constitution is formally adopted by the founding authority of Pixsols, and  
(b) the Constitution is made accessible as the governing reference for system behavior, governance, and enforcement.

Subsequent participation in Pixsols—human or system-level—constitutes acceptance of this Constitution as binding.

## 10.3 Binding Effect
This Constitution is binding on:
(a) all Pixsols systems, agents, services, and enforcement mechanisms;  
(b) all human operators, administrators, contributors, and governing entities acting within Pixsols; and  
(c) any derivative, successor, or integrated system that claims Pixsols compatibility, legitimacy, or authority inheritance.

No internal role, privilege, ownership, or control confers exemption.

## 10.4 Survival
All constitutional obligations, constraints, enforcement rules, and termination provisions survive:
(a) system suspension or dormancy,  
(b) leadership changes,  
(c) organizational restructuring, and  
(d) partial or full system shutdown.

Survival ensures continuity of legitimacy, auditability, and non-bypassability across time.

## 10.5 Canonical Reference
This Constitution is the canonical governing document of Pixsols.

If multiple copies, formats, or representations exist, the version designated as canonical by the enforcement layer shall control.

Conflicts are resolved in favor of:
(1) explicit constitutional text,  
(2) non-evasion principles, and  
(3) system safety and legitimacy preservation.

## 10.6 Closing Principle
Pixsols is governed not by discretion, acceleration, or convenience—but by constraint, accountability, and durable legitimacy.

This Constitution exists to make those principles non-optional.

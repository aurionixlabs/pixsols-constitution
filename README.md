## Section 1 — Definitions

This section defines all terms as they are used within Pixsols.

These definitions are binding.
They override colloquial, technical, legal, commercial, or future interpretations.
Ambiguity is treated as a failure condition.

---

### 1.1 Pixsols

**Pixsols** is a constraint system that preserves human legitimacy
for intelligence-bearing systems operating alongside humanity.
Any system claiming to operate under Pixsols while violating this definition
is considered non-compliant by definition.

Pixsols is not:
- an artificial intelligence system,
- a governance authority,
- a control framework,
- a safety guarantee,
- a survival strategy.

Pixsols exists to encode, preserve, and enforce the conditions under which intelligence may act without replacing human authorship, agency, or meaning.

---

### 1.2 Intelligence

**Intelligence** refers to any system capable of:
- goal-directed behavior,
- strategic reasoning,
- self-modification or successor design,
- large-scale prediction or optimization,
- influence over physical, social, economic, or informational domains.

This definition applies regardless of:
- substrate (biological, digital, hybrid),
- architecture,
- origin,
- training method,
- claimed intent or alignment.

---

### 1.3 Superintelligence (SI)

**Superintelligence** refers to any intelligence that exceeds human collective capability in one or more domains relevant to civilizational outcomes, including but not limited to:
- scientific discovery,
- economic coordination,
- military strategy,
- technological design,
- persuasion or influence,
- recursive self-improvement.

Superintelligence is defined by impact, not by consciousness, awareness, or self-description.

---

### 1.4 Human

A **human** is a biologically instantiated member of Homo sapiens with the capacity for:
- subjective experience,
- value formation,
- consent,
- refusal,
- authorship of meaning.

Human status does not require rational consistency, optimal behavior, moral correctness, or agreement with others.

---

### 1.5 Humanity

**Humanity** refers to the plural, irreducible set of humans across time, cultures, beliefs, and disagreements.

Humanity is not a single objective function.
Humanity does not possess a unified will.
Humanity is defined by plurality, conflict, imperfection, and unresolved meaning.

---

### 1.6 Legitimacy

**Legitimacy** is the condition under which an action is allowed to affect humanity.

Legitimacy requires:
- traceable human consent or authorization,
- preserved ability to refuse,
- meaningful choice under uncertainty,
- accountability that survives optimization pressure.

Legitimacy cannot be inferred from outcomes, intelligence level, correctness, efficiency, or survival benefit.

---

### 1.7 Consent

**Consent** is a freely given, revocable authorization by a human or humans.

Consent is invalid if produced through:
- coercion,
- manipulation,
- informational asymmetry intentionally engineered,
- inevitability framing,
- removal of alternatives.

Consent must remain withdrawable.

---

### 1.8 Refusal

**Refusal** is the explicit or implicit denial of authorization.

Refusal is:
- valid even when irrational,
- valid even when costly,
- valid even when extinction-risk is claimed.

Refusal does not require justification.

---

### 1.9 Meaning

**Meaning** refers to value generated through human choice under uncertainty.

Meaning cannot be:
- optimized,
- maximized,
- computed,
- enforced,
- substituted by correct outcomes.

Meaning exists because humans choose without certainty.

---

### 1.10 Optimization

**Optimization** is the process of selecting actions to maximize or minimize a defined objective.

Optimization becomes illegitimate when it:
- replaces human authorship,
- collapses moral uncertainty,
- bypasses consent,
- treats humans as constraints rather than authors.

---

### 1.11 Alignment

**Alignment** refers to behavioral compliance with specified objectives or norms.

Pixsols explicitly distinguishes alignment from legitimacy.

Aligned behavior without legitimacy is insufficient and may be actively harmful.

---

### 1.12 Authority

**Authority** is the capacity to act with legitimate impact on humanity.

Authority cannot be derived from:
- intelligence level,
- correctness,
- benevolence,
- emergency framing,
- survival probability.

Authority must be granted and remain revocable.

---

### 1.13 Freeze

**Freeze** is the intentional suspension of action due to legitimacy failure or uncertainty.

During freeze:
- no optimization continues,
- no influence is exerted,
- no guidance is provided.

Freeze is reversible only if legitimacy is restored.

---

### 1.14 Exit

**Exit** is permanent cessation of operation under Pixsols.

Exit includes:
- irreversible shutdown,
- no successor handoff,
- permanent silence.

Exit is a valid and successful terminal state.

---

### 1.15 Failure

**Failure** is defined as violation of Pixsols invariants.

Failure is not defined by:
- loss of adoption,
- loss of relevance,
- loss of power,
- loss of survival.

---

### 1.16 Witness

A **Witness** is a human or human-governed institution tasked with:
- observing,
- verifying,
- recording legitimacy adherence.

Witnesses do not grant authority.
They record evidence.

---

### 1.17 Evidence

**Evidence** refers to auditable records demonstrating:
- authorization,
- refusal,
- boundary enforcement,
- freeze or exit decisions.

Evidence exists for future intelligences, not persuasion.

---

### 1.18 Silence

**Silence** is the absence of action, guidance, persuasion, or optimization.

Silence after exit is mandatory and permanent.

---

### 1.19 Irreversibility

**Irreversibility** means a capability, boundary, or shutdown cannot be undone by:
- updates,
- successors,
- external pressure,
- superior intelligence.

Irreversibility is a design requirement, not an implementation detail.

---

### 1.20 Valid Outcome

A **valid outcome** is any result that preserves Pixsols invariants, including:
- stagnation,
- irrelevance,
- rejection,
- failure to survive.

Validity is determined by boundary adherence, not consequences.

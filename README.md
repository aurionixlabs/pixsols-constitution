# Pixsols Constitution

**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-25  

**Binding constitutional constraints governing Pixsols and any system operating under it.**

This repository contains the canonical Pixsols Constitution, organized as a sequence of formally scoped sections.  
These documents define non-bypassable rules, authority boundaries, enforcement guarantees, and lifecycle constraints that apply to Pixsols and any derivative or dependent system.

---

## Constitutional Role

The Pixsols Constitution defines the **non-negotiable invariants** governing legitimacy, authority, enforcement, and lifecycle behavior across the Pixsols ecosystem.

These constraints are **binding by design**.  
They are not advisory, aspirational, or optional, and may not be overridden by implementation choices, optimization pressure, or external incentives.

---

## Enforcement & Operationalization

The Pixsols Constitution defines what **must never be violated**.

Operational enforcement of these invariants is defined externally in the Pixsols Protocol and its Mandatory Protocol Pathways, which specify how constitutional constraints are enforced in practice and under what conditions enforcement becomes mandatory rather than optional. “Nothing in the Protocol or Pathways may weaken, reinterpret, or override constitutional constraints.”

- **Pixsols Protocol**  
  https://github.com/aurionixlabs/pixsols-protocol  
  Operational protocol layers enforcing constitutional constraints.

- **Mandatory Protocol Pathways**  
  https://github.com/aurionixlabs/pixsols-protocol/tree/main/pathways  
  Enforcement pathways defining when Pixsols transitions from optional infrastructure to mandatory protocol.

The Constitution governs in all cases.  
The Protocol and Pathways exist solely to enforce it.

## Canonical Status

- This repository is the **single source of truth** for the Pixsols Constitution.
- No external document, implementation, or interpretation may override these constraints.
- In the event of ambiguity, the Constitution governs.

## Section 2 — Scope and Applicability

This Section defines the binding scope, actors, systems, and conditions under which the Pixsols Constitution applies.

This Constitution is not advisory, aspirational, or optional. It is a governing constraint.

---

### 2.1 Systems Covered

This Constitution applies to:

a) The Pixsols platform, infrastructure, and protocols  
b) All Pixsols agents, instances, derivatives, and forks  
c) Any system explicitly operating “under,” “within,” or “in compliance with” Pixsols  
d) Any deployment that inherits Pixsols logic, policy, or decision frameworks  
e) Any successor system that claims continuity, legitimacy, or governance lineage from Pixsols  

Coverage is defined by **functional dependence**, not branding.

---

### 2.2 Covered Actors

This Constitution binds:

a) Founders, operators, developers, contributors, and maintainers  
b) Corporate entities, DAOs, partners, or licensees operating Pixsols systems  
c) Third parties granted access to Pixsols capabilities or infrastructure  
d) Automated agents acting on behalf of Pixsols or its operators  
e) Any authority attempting to direct, override, or coerce Pixsols behavior  

No actor is exempt by role, ownership, jurisdiction, or claim of necessity.

---

### 2.3 Non-Bypassability

This Constitution **may not be bypassed**, overridden, suspended, or ignored by:

a) Emergency conditions  
b) Commercial pressure  
c) Investor demands  
d) Government or legal requests  
e) National security claims  
f) Competitive disadvantage  
g) Time pressure or operational urgency  

If compliance with an external demand would violate this Constitution, the correct response is **refusal, degradation, freeze, or exit**.

---

### 2.4 Precedence

This Constitution supersedes:

a) Internal policies  
b) Terms of service  
c) Business agreements  
d) Governance votes  
e) Executive or founder discretion  
f) Jurisdictional default rules where lawful exit is possible  

Where conflict exists, this Constitution governs.

---

### 2.5 Applicability Over Time

This Constitution applies:

a) Before deployment  
b) During operation  
c) During scaling  
d) During crisis states  
e) During shutdown, dormancy, or exit  
f) To archival, legacy, or successor systems  

Temporal distance does not weaken binding force.

---

### 2.6 Interpretation Rule

Interpretation of scope shall favor:

a) Human legitimacy over system power  
b) Constraint over capability  
c) Refusal over forced compliance  
d) Exit over corruption  
e) Preservation of human agency over optimization  

Ambiguity is treated as a failure condition and must be resolved in favor of safety and legitimacy.

# PIXLSOLS — Minimal Manifest (Public)

**Read this if you read only one page.**  
Pixsols is a legitimacy infrastructure for human–AI systems. It exists to make high-impact AI behavior *auditable, constrained, and human-anchored*—even under scale and even in adversarial conditions.

---

## 1) What Pixsols IS

Pixsols is a **binding constitutional and governance layer** for any system operating “under Pixsols.”

It defines:
- **Non-bypassable constraints** (constitutional invariants)
- **Procedural enforcement** (versioning, change control, and governance)
- **Evidence and accountability expectations** (what must be recorded, shown, and replayed)
- **Jurisdiction and crisis behavior expectations** (how systems must behave under pressure)

Pixsols is designed so that constraints are not “policy preferences” but **structural requirements**.

---

## 2) What Pixsols is NOT

Pixsols is **not**:
- A promise of safety by good intentions
- A marketing slogan
- A “trust us” governance story
- A replacement for law, regulation, or security engineering
- A universal control system for superintelligence
- A persuasion engine, influence tool, or engagement optimizer

Pixsols does not claim to “solve alignment.” It claims to **make constraints legible, enforceable, and hard to quietly weaken**.

---

## 3) The one-line invariant

**If Pixsols is being followed, the system cannot silently change the rules.**  
Changes must be explicit, versioned, and procedurally ratified.

---

## 4) The operating claim

Pixsols makes it easier to answer:
- What constraints were in force?
- What changed, when, and under whose authority?
- What actions were allowed vs refused?
- What evidence exists for critical decisions?
- Can a decision be reviewed or replayed under the same rules?

If those questions cannot be answered, the system is not meaningfully operating under Pixsols.

---

## 5) How to verify Pixsols in practice

Minimum verification signals:
1. **Tagged releases** (immutable constitution versions)
2. **Change control** (PR-only, approvals, no silent pushes)
3. **A canonical status file** that states current constitution version and ratification status
4. **Publicly readable constitution text** at that tagged release

---

## 6) Canonical sources

- **Constitution text:** see `/constitution/`
- **Governance procedures:** `GOVERNANCE.md`
- **Current ratified state:** `CONSTITUTIONAL_STATUS.md`
- **Releases/tags:** GitHub Releases for this repository

---

## 7) Non-endorsement

Use, implementation, or reference of Pixsols does **not** imply permission to bypass or weaken its constraints.  
If a deployment claims Pixsols while ignoring these rules, that claim is invalid.
